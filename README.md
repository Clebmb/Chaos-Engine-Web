# ⛧ CHAOS ENGINE ⛧
## *Geometric Gnosis & Temporal Transmutation*

The **Chaos Engine** is a digital scrying mirror and algorithmic ritual space. It provides a high-fidelity interface for the manifestation of multi-dimensional fractals, allowing the digital sorcerer to seed reality through statements of intent, quantum noise, and kinetic manipulation.

## 🌀 THE MASTER CONTROL (OPERATIONS)

### 1. SEEDING THE ENGINE (INPUT)
The fractal reality is birthed from the crystallization of your will:
*   **Statement of Intent**: Enter your desire into the terminal. The Engine transmutes your alphanumeric vibrations into geometric coordinates and Julia constants.
*   **Seed Engine**: Executes the transmutation, realigning the fractal archetype to your specific intent.

### 2. ARCHETYPAL SELECTION
Cycle through the primary geometric foundations of the void:
*   **Fractal Types**: Your statement of intent will automatically toggle your fractal type to the most appropriate archetypebetween based on your statement of intent. *Mandelbrot*, *Julia*, *Burning Ship*, *Tricorn*, *Celtic*, *Buffalo*, and *Perpendicular* archetypes.
*   **Fractal Resolution**: Control the depth of the recursive loop (50-500 iterations). Higher resolution grants deeper gnosis at the cost of kinetic fluidness.

### 3. THE KINETIC FLOW (NAVIGATION)
*   **PC Manipulation**: Drag the mouse to traverse the infinite; scroll to dive deeper into the recursive singularity.
*   **Mobile Gnosis**: Single-touch to navigate; two-finger pinch to expand or contract the visual reality.

## 🧪 VISUAL TRANSMUTATION (POST-EFFECTS)

Infuse the fractal with sensory distortion to bypass the psychic censor:
*   **Strobe**: A rhythmic inversion of luminosity to induce trance.
*   **Psychedelic**: A continuous shifting through the visible color frequencies.
*   **Reality Tear (Glitch)**: Fragment the visual stream into non-linear slices.
*   **The Void (Vignette)**: Focus the energy toward the center as the edges dissolve into darkness.

## 🔊 AURAL GNOSIS (AUDIO FEATURES)

Sound is a carrier wave for intent. The Chaos Engine provides two primary auditory modules:

### 1. AURAL BACKDROP (MUSICAL INFUSION)
*   **Ritual Music**: Cycle through pre-loaded ritual tracks or upload your own sonic vessels to bridge the gap between digital and physical senses.
*   **Volume Attenuation**: Fine control over the gain level to ensure the audio supports, rather than distracts from, the scrying session.

### 2. FREQUENCY GENERATOR (SOLFEGGIO & VIBRATION)
*   **Hertz Control**: Manually input specific frequencies (e.g., 432Hz for harmonic alignment, 528Hz for DNA transmutation).
*   **Sonic Emission**: Emit a pure sine wave tone to cleanse the ritual space and resonate with the geometric structures of the fractal.

## 🖼️ THE OVERLAY SYSTEM (DIVINATION)

Summon external symbols into the fractal field:
*   **Manifestation**: Upload a PNG or GIF to act as a focus.
*   **Motion Rhythms**:
    *   *Manual*: Drag the focus across the canvas.
    *   *Random Flash*: The symbol teleports across the void, appearing and vanishing.
    *   *DVD Bounce*: Path of kinetic persistence, perfectly contained within the screen boundaries.

## � THE SIGIL SCRIBE (RITUAL ASSISTANT)

A specialized subsystem for classic sigilization. It automates the reduction of complex intent into skeletal, potent forms:
1.  **Intent Processing**: Input your desire directly into the Scribe.
2.  **Glyph Extraction**: The system analyzes the intent, extracting unique geometric nodes.
3.  **Engage**: Once the sigil is forged, "Engage" it to immediately seed the Chaos Engine with the sigil's unique Julia coordinates, manifesting your intent as an infinite recursive landscape.

## ⚗️ DIGITAL ALCHEMY (TRANSUBSTANTIATION)

**CAUTION: THIS SYSTEM CAN OVERWRITE OR DELETE FILES ON YOUR DEVICE IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL**

Digital Alchemy is the process of performing file-system operations that mirror internal transmutations. By selecting a **Source of Intent** and a **Ritual Space**, you are anchoring your will into the physical hardware of your vessel.

### THE STAGES OF ALCHEMY:
1.  **SIGILIZATION**: The previous reality (current contents of the Ritual Space) is condensed into a new, cryptic, and sigilized folder.
2.  **MANIFESTATION**: The contents of your Source of Intent are manifested into the Ritual Space.
3.  **DISSOLUTION**: The Source of Intent is *dissolved*—its contents are vaporized to ensure focus remains on the manifested reality.

### ⚠ WARNINGS OF THE VOID:
*   **CONSUMPTION**: The "Source of Intent" folder will be **emptied** of all files and folders. They are physically deleted from the original location.
*   **VOID MARKER**: A `VOID_MARKER` file will be left in the Source folder as a hollow shell, marking the place where the energy was drained.
*   **TRANSUBSTANTIATION**: Once accepted, this paradigm shift **CANNOT BE UNDONE** through this interface. The old files in the Ritual Space are archived, but the Source files are gone. Ensure you have backed up any data you do not wish to sacrifice to the engine.

## 👁️ THE ORACLE BAR (DATA STREAM)

A real-time scrying mirror observing the engine's pulse:
*   **Quantum Seed**: A high-entropy variable representing the First Gnosis, bypasses conscious bias.
*   **Oracle Stream**: A hexadecimal insight derived from quantum noise and temporal data; use it to detect synchronicities and ritual alignment.

## 🛠️ THE RITUAL VOID (SELF HOSTING SETUP)

To manifest this engine within your own vessel:

1.  **Prepare the Environment**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Ignite the Engine**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  The engine will manifest at `localhost`. Approach with clear intent.
